GraphicsAgain001 : 

 - the project name started as a response to a "ho-hum" moment...it just stayed
 - this is a test harness development for a LoRa radio. It is targeted but has
   (will have) a lot of features that can be used more generally
 - it is in part a GUI developed using Windows GDI+ in Visual Studio
 - mostly 'C' but takes advantage of the Microsoft 'C++' interface to graphics
   via GDI+
 - text output is designed around alphabets designed using "StrokeGraphics"
